    <p>Hello , We are three university students who have designed this web application/mobile application as a 
        <b><u>Proof on concept.</u></b> Where we have created an nhs symptom that will allow patients to
          fill in a symptom form then it will be submitted to a database which is held on a server.The
          receptionist will be able to retrive the form to check it has been completed and filled in correctly.
          The form will be then placed back on database on the server. Once the doctor has pulled the form the 
          symptom algorithm detector will be ran to determine possible ailments and then the doctor can confirm
          and set a priority level.
        </p>
